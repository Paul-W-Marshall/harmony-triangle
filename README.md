## Overview

**Harmony Triangle** is a reference implementation and interactive visualization of a novel color space design system, building on James Clerk Maxwell’s 1874 color triangle. This repository provides both a production-ready Next.js 14 + WebGL web app and a TypeScript toolchain for generating publication-quality figures.

Developed alongside the forthcoming arXiv paper, which details the theoretical and historical foundations of the Harmony Triangle.

## Features

- **Interactive barycentric triangle renderer**
- **sRGB / Display-P3 space toggle** (with live badge)
- **Draggable probe** showing barycentric weights, hex color, and copy-to-JSON
- **PNG export** (color-managed, space-aware)
- **TypeScript toolchain** (`/figures`) for generating publication-quality PNGs and CSV data
- **Shared color-math utilities** and JSON-configured anchors
